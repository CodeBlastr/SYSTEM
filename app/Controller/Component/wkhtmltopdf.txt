Synopsis:
  wkhtmltopdf [GLOBAL OPTION]... [OBJECT]... <output file>

Document objects:
  wkhtmltopdf is able to put several objects into the output file, an object is
  either a single webpage, a cover webpage or a table of content.  The objects
  are put into the output document in the order they are specified on the
  command line, options can be specified on a per object basis or in the global
  options area. Options from the Global Options section can only be placed in
  the global options area

  A page objects puts the content of a singe webpage into the output document.

  (page)? <input url/file name> [PAGE OPTION]...
  Options for the page object can be placed in the global options and the page
  options areas. The applicable options can be found in the Page Options and
  Headers And Footer Options sections.

  A cover objects puts the content of a singe webpage into the output document,
  the page does not appear in the table of content, and does not have headers
  and footers.

  cover <input url/file name> [PAGE OPTION]...
  All options that can be specified for a page object can also be specified for
  a cover.

  A table of content object inserts a table of content into the output document.


  toc [TOC OPTION]...
  All options that can be specified for a page object can also be specified for
  a toc, further more the options from the TOC Options section can also be
  applied. The table of content is generated via XSLT which means that it can be

  styled to look however you want it to look. To get an aide of how to do this
  you can dump the default xslt document by supplying the
  --dump-default-toc-xsl, and the outline it works on by supplying
  --dump-outline, see the Outline Options section.
